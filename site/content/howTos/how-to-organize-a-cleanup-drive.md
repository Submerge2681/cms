You can host a clean-up drive on your own or as part of an organization.

The following points can be considered as part of your plan:

### Step 1: Location

The first step is to identify a location(s) where you think a clean-up drive can be successfully organized. <br />
Ideally, it should be easily accessible by public transport. <br />
It is advisable to visit the location beforehand to scout the area and gauge the available amenities, waste disposal system, gathering point, etc.  <br />

### Step 2: Clearance from local authorities

Different cities have different policies and tolerance levels to such citizen-organized events. Hence, checking with the local authorities and asking for permission guarantees a safe and hassle-free experience for the drive. 
Approach your local administrative body and politely ask for permission to conduct the event at the decided location(s). 

### Step 3: Equipment/Refreshments/Incentives

The budget available will decide what you can incorporate from most of this section. <br />
Food, water, and equipment can be arranged for the volunteers. In general, the following tools are required as part of the equipment: reusable gloves, gunny bags to collect the waste, and a weighing scale to measure the waste collected. <br /> 
To increase volunteer participation, you can incentivize their involvement with small tokens, gifts, travel allowance, etc. <br />

### Step 4: Volunteer mobilization

Once all the previous sections have been covered, you must focus on publicizing your event and drawing in lots of people. <br />
Public outreach, like social media posts and posters, can help disseminate the information about your clean-up drive to a larger audience. <br />
Preferably, maintain a list of prospective volunteers by asking them to fill out a google form. This will help in estimating the turnout and preparing the items from the previous section accordingly. <br />

### Step 4: Engagement

Now that you hopefully have everything in order, it is important to make the clean-up experience memorable for the volunteers. If possible, conduct an introductory ice-breaker to destress the participants and lighten the mood. 
Be responsible and address any raised concerns. <br />
Conduct post clean-up activities like distribution of food etc. <br />
Ask the volunteers for their feedback and consensually collect their contact information for future clean-ups. <br />
